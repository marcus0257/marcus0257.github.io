    <h2>Genre Context</h2>
    <blockquote>
      According to Rolf Potts, despite profound societal and technological changes, 
      “the core task of travel writing—going slow, experiencing, listening, seeking nuance, reflecting—hasn’t changed much” over the years.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The travel blog genre refers to web-based journaling platforms where individuals go somewhere 
      and share their experiences online through writing-intensive posts, photos, and videos. 
      The genre offers insight, information, stories, and facts about a wide variety of destinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this genre, point-of-view matters. A strong travel blog not only reports on what’s being experienced, 
      but also tells readers about the “who” behind the experience. Readers should get to know the author, 
      connect with their perspective, and want to follow their journey.
