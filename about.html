    <h1>Welcome To About Marcus Diaz</h1>
 <p>   
   Whats up, my name is Marcus Diaz.   <br>
   I was born and raised in Providence Rhode Island. <br>
   Growing Up I never really got into coding/programming <br>
   but as I got into college I had to explore more careers. <br>
   I didn't have much coding experience in life but so far<br>
   I enjoy programming websites and making cool animations. </p>
