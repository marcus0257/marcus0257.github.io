        <h2>Hi, I'm Marcus Diaz</h2>
        <p>
            I grew up in a tight-knit, underprivileged community, where coding was never really an option for me. However, everything changed when I discovered programming during my college years. Since then, I've been passionate about coding and have developed a keen interest in creating websites and animations.
        </p>

        <p>
            My journey has inspired me to make a difference in my community by increasing the representation of minorities in the coding world. I believe in the power of technology to transform lives and am dedicated to breaking down barriers and creating opportunities for others like me.
        </p>
