    <h1>Welcome To About Marcus Diaz</h1>
    <p>   Whats up, my name is Marcus Diaz.   <br>
     I was born and raised in Providence Rhode Island. <br>
     Growing Up I never really got into coding/programming <br>
     but as I got into college I had to explore more careers, <br>
     I didn't have much coding experience in life but so far<br>
      I enjoy programming websites and making cool animations. </p>
