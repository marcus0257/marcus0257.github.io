  <h1>Grant Proposal: Johnnycakes Historical Marker</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>GPS Location of Proposed Installation</h2>
    <p><strong>Latitude:</strong> 41.5126 N<br />
       <strong>Longitude:</strong> 71.5919 W
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposed marker installation spot is in Usquepaugh, Rhode Island, at the historic site of a working grist mill, known for producing traditional Rhode Island Johnnycake meal. Though still operational, the mill is not the focus of the proposal, instead, the marker commemorates Johnnycakes, a deeply rooted regional dish whose origins span centuries of Indigenous, colonial, and local history.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site, nestled beside the Queen's River, is symbolic of the culinary tradition that shaped, and continues to reflect, New England’s foodways. Johnnycakes, a cornmeal flatbread originally prepared by Indigenous peoples and adopted by early settlers, are especially associated with Rhode Island identity. The marker's location is ideal for interpreting this historical food practice in context, without promoting any active business.

    <h3>Johnnycakes: A Taste of Rhode Island's History</h3>
    <p>
      From Native tradition to colonial staple, Johnnycakes have long defined Rhode Island’s culinary identity. Made from locally ground white flint cornmeal, these corn cakes trace back to the techniques of the region’s Indigenous peoples. By the 18th century, they had become a household food across New England. Today, Johnnycakes remain a symbol of cultural endurance, often served hot off the griddle, connecting generations through a shared taste of history.

    <h2>Closing Paragraph</h2>
    <p>
      Johnnycakes are more than a food, they are a living piece of Rhode Island’s identity. From 18th-century hearths to 21st-century breakfast tables, this simple cornmeal cake connects generations through taste and tradition. A marker in Usquepaugh, where traditional meals are still ground and prepared, would not honor a business, it would honor a heritage. Through this marker, visitors will encounter not just a recipe, but a resilient narrative of adaptation, identity, and cultural exchange that has flavored Rhode Island’s history for centuries. In celebrating Johnnycakes, we also celebrate the communities that preserved them: Indigenous peoples, early American cooks, and local families who kept the tradition alive. This dish embodies resilience, connection, and continuity. A marker here would not only commemorate history, it would invite others to taste it and remember the rich cultural tapestry behind this humble but powerful culinary tradition.
