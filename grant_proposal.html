  <h1>Grant Proposal</h1>
  <h2>Research & Annotated Bibliography</h2>

  <p>This section highlights the foundational research I conducted while exploring the cultural history and significance of Johnnycakes for my WRT 305 grant proposal. The goal was to uncover how this simple food connects Indigenous knowledge and New England tradition, with a focus on Rhode Island‚Äôs food identity.</p>

    <strong>Smith, Andrew F.</strong>  
    <br><em>The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America</em>, 2004.  
    <p>This scholarly source examines the evolution of Johnnycakes and notes that Northerners still call it Johnnycake, emphasizing its cultural persistence in New England. It helped validate the role of food as cultural memory and deepen my understanding of regional food identity.</p>

    <strong>‚ÄúJohnnycake | Food | Britannica.‚Äù</strong>  
    <br>Encyclopedia Britannica, 2024.  
    <p>This article provides basic preparation details and placed Johnnycakes within the broader category of North American cornbreads. Though not as in-depth, it supported my foundational understanding of the dish before exploring its deeper cultural significance.</p>

    <strong>Fitzgerald, Faye.</strong>  
    <br>‚ÄúFrom Cornmeal to Culture: The Indigenous Origins of Johnnycakes in New England.‚Äù <em>Journal of American Food History</em>, 2018.  
    <p>Fitzgerald‚Äôs article was instrumental. It revealed how Johnnycakes were more than survival food‚Äîthey were a form of cultural instruction passed from Indigenous communities to colonists. This shifted my perspective and shaped my final proposal.</p>
