  <h1>Travel Guide: Kenyon’s Grist Mill & Johnnycakes</h1>
  <p><strong>By Marcus Diaz</strong></p>

  <p>The purpose of this travel blog is to transport readers into the heart of Rhode Island’s culinary heritage by immersing them in the sights, smells, textures, and traditions surrounding Kenyon’s Grist Mill and its iconic Johnnycakes.</p>

  <p>More than just a description of food, this piece aims to offer a sensory and historical journey, capturing the coarse grind of stone-milled cornmeal, the golden crispness of a freshly cooked Johnnycake, and the quiet rhythm of life at one of the state’s oldest working mills.</p>

  <p>By blending factual detail with personal reflection and local insight, the blog serves as a guide for travelers seeking an authentic taste of the Ocean State. It equips readers with knowledge about regional food traditions, sustainable practices, and the cultural roots that make Johnnycakes more than a dish—they are a story.</p>

  <p>This project contributes to Rhode Island’s culinary map by helping visitors discover not just what to eat, but where that food comes from and why it matters. It encourages travelers to look beyond tourist brochures and engage deeply with place-based cuisine, supporting local producers, honoring Indigenous foodways, and understanding how food can preserve memory, identity, and connection across generations.</p>
