    Through the process of creating my travel blog, I developed both my research and storytelling skills. I learned how to combine factual information with personal reflection to make a compelling narrative that invites readers into a deeper cultural and historical experience.

    I gained practice in writing with a strong sense of place, incorporating sensory details to capture the sounds, smells, and textures of Rhode Islandâ€™s food traditions. I also strengthened my ability to frame content through a clear purpose and audience awareness, helping me guide readers through both the past and present significance of Johnnycakes.

    In terms of technical skills, I improved in organizing web content using HTML and designing with intention. This project also helped me think more critically about how to represent local stories in a respectful, engaging way. Overall, I came away with a better understanding of digital storytelling, food culture, and how writing can preserve identity and community.
