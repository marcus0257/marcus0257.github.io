    <h2>Reflection: What I Learned from Writing Weekly Reading Journals</h2>
    <p>Through the reading journals, I learned how to analyze texts more deeply by focusing on how authors use setting, voice, and metaphor to deliver meaning. Instead of just summarizing, I practiced making connections between the author’s ideas and my own experiences. This helped me become more confident in writing reflectively and seeing how creative nonfiction can blend personal insight with broader social issues.</p>
    <p>I also developed a stronger sense of structurehow to introduce a hook, reflect on key points, and respond with a unique perspective. Over time, I became better at identifying themes like memory, identity, and food justice, and I began thinking more critically about how writing can create empathy and cultural understanding. These skills directly supported my travel blog project and my growth as a writer overall.</p>
