  <h1>Final Reflection – WRT 305</h1>
  <p><strong>Author:</strong> Marcus Diaz</p>
  <p><strong>Course:</strong> Travel Writing (WRT 305), Summer 2025</p>

  <h2>What I Learned</h2>
  <p>WRT 305 has transformed the way I think about writing—not just as a tool for communication, but as a method of reflection, exploration, and connection. Through assignments focused on travel, food, and storytelling, I learned how to identify rhetorical situations and craft pieces that speak to specific audiences and purposes. I experimented with style, voice, and genre, all while gaining a deeper appreciation for culture and the stories behind everyday experiences.</p>

  <h2>Evidence of Learning</h2>
  <p>One of the clearest examples of growth came from my blog post <em>“Magical Thinking Apron-Cape”</em>, where I analyzed Nina Furstenau’s reflections on cooking as a heroic act. In my post, I wrote: </p>
  <blockquote>“If superheroes wear capes, then maybe home cooks wear aprons—the magic is in the act of care.”</blockquote>
  <p>This line captured my voice emerging—thoughtful, reflective, and personal. I also found strength in my interview piece, where I used open-ended questions to dig deeper into someone else’s travel perspective. The revision process pushed me to cut filler and tighten my writing, making it more effective and engaging.</p>

  <h2>Writing Process & Revision</h2>
  <p>Across the course, I moved through brainstorming, freewriting, drafting, peer review, and revision cycles. Peer feedback was essential—both giving and receiving it helped sharpen my understanding of what makes writing work. I used feedback from classmates and Professor Roth to improve my pacing, expand on key moments, and clarify purpose. For example, after early comments suggested my food story lacked a personal connection, I rewrote the opening to include a childhood memory that immediately grounded the narrative in emotion.</p>

  <h2>Creative Choices</h2>
  <p>I made intentional choices to explore multiple genres, including blog posts, personal essays, and interview-based features. These allowed me to experiment with structure and tone. I often used metaphor and sensory detail to immerse readers, particularly in food writing. My decision to hyperlink relevant media and research in my digital posts also reflects what I learned about multimodal storytelling.</p>

  <h2>Applying This Beyond Class</h2>
  <p>This course helped me discover a stronger sense of my writing voice—something I can bring into my professional writing, future creative projects, or even coding documentation where clarity and tone still matter. I’ve also developed better research habits through fieldwork and source evaluation, skills I’ll apply in other disciplines and jobs where communication and curiosity intersect.</p>

  <h2>What I Now Know About Writing</h2>
  <p>I’ve come to understand writing as an evolving process—not just a means to deliver facts, but a space to build relationships, ask questions, and tell powerful stories. This course helped me become more confident, more curious, and more open to revision. From exploring food culture to studying travel narratives, I now appreciate how stories can preserve memory, shape identity, and build bridges between people and places.</p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>WRT 305 taught me that good writing starts with listening—whether to others, to a place, or to myself. I’m proud of how much I’ve written and grown this semester. From small blog posts to deep-dive features, each assignment pushed me to think critically and write purposefully. Thank you, Professor Roth, for fostering a space of creativity, feedback, and exploration. I leave this course more confident as a writer—and more excited to keep traveling, writing, and growing.</p>
