        <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
<p>
  My name is Marcus Diaz, and I’m a senior at the University of Rhode Island majoring in Computer Science. While most of my academic work focuses on programming and data systems, I took WRT 305 – a travel and food writing course – to explore a different side of storytelling. This class taught me how to slow down, reflect, and observe the world through the lens of food and culture.
</p>

<p>
  Throughout the semester, I conducted field interviews, researched food-related issues, and experimented with different writing styles and genres. I learned to balance creativity with structure, and gained skills in crafting grant proposals, travel blogs, and reflective essays.
</p>

<p>
  This site serves as my digital portfolio for WRT 305. You’ll find my completed works organized by category: a grant proposal to support community food literacy, a personal travel blog capturing a local culinary experience, and reflections that trace my growth as a writer. I invite you to explore each section using the navigation links above.
</p>

  Thank you for visiting and engaging with my work!
