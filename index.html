   <h1>Welcome To Marcus' World Of Programming</h1>
<p> The act of converting concepts, answers, and instructions into binary machine code, <br>
 a language that computers can comprehend, is known as coding. Coding is the method used by <br>
 people to communicate with computers. Computers can obey a set of instructions made through <br>
 code.  What a computer can and cannot do is governed by these instructions. Coding enables <br>
 developers to create programs, including websites and apps. Computer programmers may <br>
 instruct machines on how to better and more quickly process data. </p>
